# 秋风起蟹脚肥，买十几只大闸蟹来给家人尝尝鲜，四伯爷第一次吃！
# Autumn is the best season for crabs. Uncle tries hairy crabs for the first time!

# 简介

# 秋天是吃蟹的好季节，中秋节后的河蟹尤为肥美。偶然了解到四伯和伯娘还没吃过大闸蟹，那的确要让他们尝尝鲜。实践证明有的时候不需要迷信越贵越好，对于食材来说新鲜和会挑选更加重要。
# Autumn is the best season for crab. After the Mid-Autumn Festival, hairy crabs are especially delicious. I happen to know that my uncle and aunt have never eaten hairy crabs before, so I decided to buy some for them to try. Today's video also busts the myth that expensive things are better. For ingredients, it is more important to use the fresh ones and know how to choose.
