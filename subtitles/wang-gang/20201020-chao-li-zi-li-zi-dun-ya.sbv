# 厨师长分享：“糖炒栗子”和“栗子烧鸭”的做法，一栗两吃，谢谢兄弟！
# Chef Wang shares: "Sand Roasted Chestnuts" and "Braised Duck with Chestnuts", thanks Bro!

# 简介

# @华农兄弟 兄弟家的板栗就是香啊！虽说听说都是摄影小哥家里的😂 大家如果也想在家尝试炒板栗的话，直接搜索炒板栗专用砂就可以买到类似的黑色砂砾，全程用中小火用砂砾来均匀导热至板栗就可以炒出非常香糯的板栗了。
# @Huanong Brothers, your chestnuts are so delicious! If any one want to try sand roasted chestnuts in home, you can search for roasting sand for getting similar sand for roasting chestnuts. Use medium low heat through the roasting process, let the sand heat the chestnuts evenly. You can also get the perfect roasted chestnuts in home.

I asked him for some chestnuts.

0:00:11.409,0:00:13.219

He's so generous.

0:00:17.090,0:00:18.189

He's very generous.

0:00:18.189,0:00:20.610

Here might weigh 10 jin (5 kg).

0:00:20.880,0:00:23.160
# 他自己都没有多少居然给我发这么多过来
He doesn't even have much, but he's giving me so much.

0:00:23.200,0:00:24.165
# 我只是说说而已
I'm just joking around about asking chestnuts.

0:00:24.240,0:00:25.640
# 他送了这么多我怕吃不完
He gave me so much, I was afraid I wouldn't finish it all.

0:00:25.640,0:00:29.939
# 所以就搞了一个鸭子待会用这个来烧
So I decided to cook a duck with it later.

0:00:30.370,0:00:32.209
# 当然这个鸭子可能也烧不完
Of course, the duck probably won't finish all the chestnuts either.

0:00:32.397,0:00:35.315

I will use traditional roast method to roast some of them.

0:00:35.732,0:00:38.585

Cut it up and blanch them.

0:00:51.025,0:00:52.452

The shell will expand and contract.

0:00:52.627,0:00:55.090
# 它一旦熟了之后啊它就自己爆出来
Once it's cooked, the fruit will be easy to come out.

0:00:55.090,0:00:58.244
# 如果说我们就这样生剥的话是剥不干净的
If we just peel it raw, it won't come out clean.

0:00:58.780,0:01:01.115

It won't peel off until the shell is broken.

0:01:01.130,0:01:01.630
