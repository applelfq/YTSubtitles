# 江苏六角金刚蹄，个个用刀剁3下，烤黄用白糖！闻着有烧鸡的焦香
# Hexagon Jin‘gangti in Jiangsu: chopped 3 times and baked with sugar, smells like roasted chicken

# 简介

# 夕阳美如画，清风醉晚霞。下午时分，我在江苏扬州的运河边散步，闻到了炉火炙烤面食的味道，在道路的一旁，有一家小店围满了人，两个火炉冒着热气，刚出锅的金刚脐外表金黄，颜色诱人，有6个花瓣的形状，这是江苏的特色小吃，一个卖1.5元，很多顾客都是几十个的买，一炉的金刚脐都不够卖的！我等了一会买了5个，趁热就直接坐在路边吃，味道略甜，里面松软带有孔隙，紧贴炉壁的一面比较坚硬，口感脆爽。这是一道传统小吃，看似简单，其实制作比较讲究，看视频了解吧。
# The sunset is picturesque as the wind flows with the sunset glow. I was walking along the canal in Yangzhou, Jiangsu, when I smelled fresh bakery. On one side of the road, a small restaurant is crowded with people and two stoves steaming. Freshly baked Jin'gangti has a petal shape with golden outlook and attractive color. It is a special street food in Jiangsu, sales only 1.5 yuan each. Many customers buy in bulk so one stove of Jin’gangti is certainly not enough. I bought 5 after waiting and eat them fresh by the road. It tastes sweet and spongy, with a crispy side previously in contact with the stove. The traditional snack looks simple but is elegantly made. Check out the video!
