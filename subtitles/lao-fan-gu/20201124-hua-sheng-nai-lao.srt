00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,400
# 天气开始凉了
It’s getting cold these days

2
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:03,240
# 咱们得弄一冬天喝的
Let’s make something perfect for the winter season

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:04,840
# 叫花生奶酪
It’s called Peanut Milk Junket

4
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:08,640
# 今天就是一盘花生米 还有两袋奶
We only need some peanuts, two bags of milk

5
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,400
# 先把这花生米给它炸一下
First let’s fry the peanuts

6
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,640
# 花生米去皮有一个小窍门
There is a small trick in removing the peanut skin

7
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,080
# 开水烫两遍
Soak it twice in hot water

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,880
# 泡的时间不要太长
Not for too long

9
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,720
# 泡得了赶快捻 特别好捻
Quickly soak them in hot water then peal the skin off immediate

10
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:18,520
# 一泡长了
If you soak them for two long

11
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,960
# 花生米一涨再捻就不好捻了
The peanut will absorb too much water and swell, making it too difficult to peal its skin

12
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,440
# 凉油下锅慢慢浸炸
Peanuts in, while the oil is still cold and fry them slowly

13
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,920
# 花米不炸它不香 必须要炸一下
You must fry the peanuts to get the maximum aroma

14
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,160
# 在家里边不愿吃炸的也没问题
If you are cooking at home and you want to avoid frying

15
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,000
# 也可以烤一烤
You can also roast it

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,440
# 冒泡了你看啊 关小火
See the little bubbles? Now let’s lower the heat

17
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:34,920
# 开始大火因为油是凉的
We start with high heat to warm up the oil quickly

18
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,120
# 等冒泡了以后火要小一点
Once the bubbles come out, we need to lower the heat

19
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,560
# 攉拢的时候听听声音
Listen while you stir it

20
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,960
# 你看这声音有点发闷
It sounds a bit muffled

21
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,440
# 现在表面这些泡
These bubbles that are coming out

22
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,200
# 就是花生米当中的水分
They are moisture in the peanuts

23
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,120
# 平时炸花生米
When you fry peanuts

24
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,520
# 最不好炸的是带皮的花生米
It’s more difficult when the skins are still intact

25
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,040
# 你看不见颜色
Because you cannot see the color change

26
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:52,920
# 还有就是
Also

27
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,280
# 泡的时间稍微长一点的花生米
Those that have been soaked for too long

28
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:57,080
# 在炸的时候很容易扒锅
They will stick to the pan

29
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,080
# 如果泡时间长了
If you soak them for too long

30
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,960
# 我们可以放这儿先晾一晾
You can first leave them drying for a while

31
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,360
# 或者入烤箱弄八十度
Ow roast them in a 80 degree oven

32
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,720
# 烤它三分钟两分钟
For about 2-3 minutes

33
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,560
# 脱出去水分再开始炸
Remove the moisture and then start frying

34
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,480
# 炸出来以后
When fried properly

35
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:11,160
# 花生米的表面它不起泡 特别的酥脆
The peanuts will have smooth surface and be extremely crispy

36
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:15,920
# 听声啊 看这泡也少了
Listen to that, there are less bubbles now

37
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,320

38
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,320
# 温水洗
Wash them with warm water

39
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,440
# 表面漂起了油花 给它洗掉了
To get rid of the excess oil

40
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,880

41
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,320
# 开始粉碎
Now we can grind them

42
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,120
# 来点纯净水
Add pure water

43
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:30,920
# 一按
Here we go

44
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,680
# 这个渣子再搁点奶
We can pour some milk to these residues

45
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,440
# 熬成粗渣子有口感的
And cook them into a little bit of a rough texture

46
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,840
# 喝的时候有点像咱们那个棒子面粥
A bit like the corn flake porridge

47
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,960
# 好了 开火
OK bring the heat on

48
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,320
# 二伯 你看这浆都挂勺 很稠
Look how thick this is, Er Bai, it’s sticking to the spoon

49
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,960
# 两盒奶
Two bottles of milk

50
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,120
# 冰糖大爷咱搁进去了
Let me put the crystal sugar in

51
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,280
# 搁点冰糖或者是砂糖
Either crystal sugar or powdered sugar is fine

52
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,160
# 稠 叫酪
This junket is expected to be thick

53
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,200
# 稀的像这样的 就像茶
Thinner dishes like this are similar to tea, like Mee Teh

54
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,520
# 酪就要挂点杯子 稍微稠一点
It has to be a bit sticky, a bit thick

55
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,800
# 就是米汤芡
Like a thick porridge

56
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,840
# 早年我们国宴当中
Back in the days when we were preparing the State Banquet

57
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,920
# 有很多根据宴会（人数）的多与少
Depending on the number of participants

58
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:18,000
# 什么杏仁茶 花生奶酪
We would make Almond tea, or this peanut milk junket

59
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,040
# 这是多的
For a large group

60
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,360
# 小宴会上我们就拔丝苹果了 八宝饭
For a smaller group we would make toffee apple, or Ba Bao Rice

61
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,920
# 像这种几百人上千人的宴会
For large groups with hundreds of people

62
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,520
# 就得给这个了
We need this

63
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,080
# 花生奶酪杏仁茶
Dishes like this or the apricot kernel tea

64
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,080
# 小型宴会还有什么
For a small banquet

65
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,600
# 像夏天的杏仁豆腐
We also make apricot kernel jelly for the summer

66
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,440
# 淀粉拢点芡
We need some slurry in there

67
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:40,320

68
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,560

00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,400
# 这就好啦
That’s done

74
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,600
# 咱们把这浮沫篦出去
Let’s use the sieve to make it clean

75
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:05,440
# 有这浮沫它不好看 也不好吃
It will look better, and taste better

76
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,360
# 八成满就行了
Fill it up to 80%

77
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,160

# 它不单单的是一碗酪的问题
This is more than a bowl of junket
