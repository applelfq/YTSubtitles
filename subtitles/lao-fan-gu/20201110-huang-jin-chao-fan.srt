00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,920

00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:11,800

5
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,560
# 头天的剩米饭 一般炒饭都是剩米饭
We often used leftover rice

00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,960
# 润润锅 家里边有不粘锅的
Add some oil to prevent sticking

00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,680
# 咱就不用聊了 怎么都不粘
If you use non-stick fry pan, we don't need to do the rest steps. It is not sticky

8
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:22,120
# 怎么润呢 我的工作经验告诉我
From my work experiences

9
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,160
# 一定要把油加进去
Add some oil first

10
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,440
# 然后慢慢的让它加热
Then heat it up slowly

11
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,880
# 怎么也得到六成以上 关火多焖一会儿
heat it for at least 60 percent (180 C). Turn off the heat and leave it for a while

12
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,040
# 这样它的油会渗进去一些
In order to let oil seeps in

13
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,160
# 在热的时候表面它就不粘了
When the pan is hot, it will not stick

14
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,160
# 热的时候它是往上顶气
Steam will rise while the pan is hot

15
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,640
# 准备点什么料呢 我看准备了蛋黄了
What did you prepare for ingredients? I have prepared egg yolks.

16
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,920
# 炒米饭黄金色是由蛋黄来完成的
Fired rice’s golden comes from the egg yolks

17
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,720
# 那么米饭来讲
For rice

18
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,840
# 新米饭和隔夜饭
Freshly cooked rice or leftover rice

19
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,640
# 都没有什么太大的问题
Are both okay

20
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,200
# 那么主要是米饭焖完之后
After the rice is finished

21
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,160
# 表面它不能开花
Make sure it doesn’t break down

22
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,080
# 开花炒完之后 表面它就
If it’s broken

23
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,360
# 达不到那种光洁度了 就很散
It will not be as smooth as a whole grain of rice

24
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,320
# 再有一定要检查
Next, double check

25
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,240
# 米好坏的程度是哪里
The extend of the rice’s quality

26
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,880
# 蒸熟之后淀粉它会糊化
When steamed, there is starch gelatinization going on

27
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,080
# 糊化之后是晶莹剔透的
If the rice is crystal clear after gelatinization

28
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,640
# 这应该是新米
That should be fresh rice

29
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,840
# 如果蒸熟之后又散花 还不剔透
If it’s not, the rice is broken and not clear

30
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,240
# 那证明是陈米 炒饭就不好炒了
That should be old rice, it will be harder to make fried rice

31
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,640
# 所以一炒它就会碎掉
Old rice tends to break down when you fry it

32
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,840
# 它难以呈现是粒粒分明
So it’s hard to be separated from each other

33
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,720
# 锅润的差不多了
The pan is moist enough to prevent sticking

34
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,920
# 先别着急 关小火 等着它没关系
Don’t worry, turn to low heat and wait

35
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,200
# 时间越长 它润的越透彻
Pan will be moister as time goes on

36
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,080
# 它就更不容易粘锅
It will more likely to prevent stick-pan

37
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,600
# 咱们这些米饭需要放三个蛋黄
We need three egg yolks for these amount of rice

38
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,040
# 你看到没有
You see

39
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:44,280
# 今天隋师傅先把鸡蛋拌到米饭里边
Mr. Sui mix the yolks with the rice first

40
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,920
# 金黄金黄的
Golden

41
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,800
# 米饭如果在冰箱里拿出来比较凉
If the rice is still cool after taking out from the fridge

42
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,680
# 凉了之后下锅
Fry it when it’s cool

43
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,200
# 需要很长时间才会热
Will take a long time to heat up

44
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,920
# 我们就不如放在微波炉里边
we can put it in the microwave

45
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,400
# （提前）给它简单加热一下
Heat it up beforehand

46
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,600
# 加热到二十来度三十来度不冰手
Around 20 to 20 degrees Celsius

47
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,440
# 而且它容易散
Cool rice tends to break down

48
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,720
# 为什么隔夜饭有的时候好炒
Why we prefer to use leftover rice

49
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,640
# 它其实就是不容易粘锅 它容易散开
because it will not stick to the pan

50
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,200
# 再有 特别凉的米饭放到锅里边
Moreover, extremely cold rice

51
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,680
# 它特别容易扒锅
Are likely to stick to the pan

52
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,040
# 温度的反差 温度反差太大了
Due to the extreme difference in temperature

53
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,880
# 拌匀了就行了
Mix it thoroughly

54
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:16,120
# 咱们这个锅润透了
The pan is moist enough

55
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,280

56
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,160
# 开火 炒米饭的锅一定要干净
Turn on fire and make sure the pan is clean

57
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,120
# 看它有没有黑渣子 很干净
Look, it’s not black, means it’s clean

58
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,480
# 这就证明炒饭没问题
So it’s good for frying

59
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,480
# 它不会影响咱们出菜的整体的颜色
Since it will not contaminate the rice

60
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:33,240
# 放点葱油 增加炒饭的香气
Add some green onion oil to add some aroma

61
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,560
# 葱 要想让它炸出香味
Green onion, if you want the aroma to release

62
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,600
# 就得变成金黄色
It should turn gold

63
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,360
# 金黄色容易出黑渣
But it will be blackish when it’s gold

64
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,840
# 所以咱们就食其味不见其物
So we just eat it instead of seeing it

65
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,560
# 温油 三成热
Heat the oil around 30 percent (90 C)

66
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,760
# 下锅之后 不着急扒拉它
Don’t fry it immediately

67
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,920
# 慢慢的 下面凝固了 再扒拉一下
Fry it when it’s solidified underneath

68
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,280
# 完了再凝固上面的
Then fry it to make the rice above to solidified

69
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,040
# 您快速炒 有可能这个蛋就脱掉了
It you fry it too quickly, the egg will separate from the rice

70
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,400
# 就小火不着急 慢慢让它成熟着
So just take your time and stay in low heat

71
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,360
# 米饭粒越整越晶莹剔透
The longer it takes the clearer the rice

72
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,760
# 这黄颜色越好看
And the goldish the color

73
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,600
# 然后旁边锅热了 咱们炒蛋白
Another pan has heated up, let’s fry the egg whites

74
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,360
# 一是不浪费 二是增加一个颜色
Because we don’t want to waste and it will add some color to the fry rice

75
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,160
# 不着急 凝固就行
Don’t worry, wait until it’s one piece

76
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:14,960
# 然后加点盐调味
And season it with salt

77
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,640
# 鸡蛋当中含有谷氨酸钠
Eggs contain sodium glutamate

78
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,480
# 所以就不用再加味精了
So there’s no need to add MSG

79
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,160
# 然后把配料加进去
Then add other ingredients

80
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,640
# 蛋白差不多了
Egg whites are almost done

81
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,760
# 你看这颜色 中火
Look at that color, medium heat

82
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,960
# 黄白分明 加上胡萝卜青豆 颜色美观
Golden and white, along with the carrots and peas

83
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,560

84

# 黄金炒饭 出锅啦

00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:45,320

# 你看着啊 每粒米饭
