00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:14,800

00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,800

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,320
# 这是一斤面 大约半斤水
This is one jin flour (0.5KG), About half jin water (0.25KG)

10
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,560
# 这个面 有的面吃水有的面不吃水
Some flour absorbs more water than others

11
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,320
# 说半斤水 但是最后还得灵活掌握
Even we said half jin water (0.25KG), we still need to be flexible about it

# 今天咱用的是中筋粉

13
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,240
# 防止饺子这面不得劲儿 搁点盐
Put in some salt in case the dough isn’t al dente enough

14
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:37,400
# 盐可以增加面粉的筋度
Salt can help to build the gluten of the flour

15
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,280
# 所以说为什么你不给他拿高筋
So why didn’t you give him the bread flour

16
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,480
# 他就拿盐代替一下
He uses salt as an alternative

17
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,480
# 这和面要想让它均匀
If you want to get an even dough

18
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,880
# 先把这面打成啰嗦
Knead the flour into strips first

19
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:51,480
# 您看您真是 一出手就知道是老手

20
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:56,240
# 打成啰嗦我们逐渐的加点水

21
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,560
# 您打大疙瘩汤也好吃
The dough drop soup you made was really delicious

22
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,960

00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,520
# 这时候我们可以往一块揣一揣
Then we can knead them together

24
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,280
# 还是那句话 三光
Again, “san guang” (bowl is clean, hands are clean, the dough is neat)

25
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,320
# 看看 半斤水 半斤水没了 正好
Look at it, half jin water (0.25KG), just the right amount

26
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,560

Then we keep kneading

27
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,680
# 原来饭店有时候包饺子
In the past, restaurants sometimes made dumplings

28
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,720
# 咱们到那也得学去
We would go there and learn it

29
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,840
# 你看这个面
Check out this dough

30
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,320
# 我们为了让它光 还要蘸点水
To make it neat, we need to add a little more water

31
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:30,560
# 做面食就得勤揉 把面揉润了
When we make food with flour, we need to knead it a lot to make it moist

32
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,040
# 行 找一个布一盖 找块小布
Done. Let’s find a cloth to cover it

33
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:38,120
# 得是湿的 饧着 给我
The cloth has to be wet. Let’s rest the dough. Give it to me.

34
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,200

35
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:47,440
# 洗洗手 现在第二步该是打馅
Wash my hands. Now the next step is to make the stuffing

36
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,720
# 全齐了我给你介绍介绍啊

37
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,480
# 你看葱姜量都挺大
Lots of scallions and ginger

38
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:55,760
# 白菜 是隋坡一刀一刀切的 没剁
Napa cabbage (only the leaves). Sui Po cut it, didn’t chop it.

39
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,440
# 咱这要说明一下 白菜尽量别剁
We want to be clear, try not to chop the Napa cabbage

40
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,040
# 您看多整齐
How even it is!

41
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,560
# 花椒水 热水泡的花椒水

42
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,040
# 羊肉我们今天是事先给剁好了
We chopped the lamb ahead today

43
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:09,920
# 这是羊的后腿
This is the lamb hind leg

44
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,720
# 打这羊肉馅
Time to make the lamb stuffing

45
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,400
# 我们第一个要放花椒水
First, we put in the Sichuan pepper steeped water

46
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,560
# 羊肉是吃花椒的
lamb need to pair up with the Sichuan pepper

47
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,840
# 最好的配伍就是花椒 去膻
It is the best combination to get rid of the gamey smell

48
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,560
# 下盐
Add salt

49
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,280

50
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,680
# 酱油
Soy sauce

51
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,440
# 来点老抽 看看颜色
Some dark soy sauce to give it some color

52
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,120
# 白胡椒粉 两克够了
White pepper powder, 2g is enough

53
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,000
# 这个我们开始用手打馅
We use our hands to beat the stuffing

54
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,720
# 手打馅打的匀 打的实在
The stuffing is more even and solid using the hand

55
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,160
# 朝一个方向打
Mix it with one direction

56
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,800
# 跟大爷似的 实实在在的
Just like Da Ye, solid

57
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:45,040
# 得摔上劲儿 就跟你摔丸子似的
You need to throw it to get the texture like you throw the meatballs

58
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,680
# 为什么我不习惯用筷子搅
Why I can’t get used to mixing the stuffing with chopsticks

59
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,640
# 有时候打的不匀 没劲儿
Sometimes it wasn’t mixed evenly and tender

60
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,960
# 在吃饺子里边 一般我们不加料酒
When we made the dumpling stuffing, we don’t normally use cooking wine

61
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:57,440
# 因为它煮的 那酒味出不出去
Because when it boils, the alcohol wouldn’t volatilize

62
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,200
# 所以不加
So we don’t add cooking wine

63
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,760

64
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,000
# 又加点老抽
Add more dark soy sauce

65
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,240
# 大爷的饺子最关键是什么
The key points of Da Ye’s dumpling

66
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,760
# 您看都能看明白了
You can see them clearly

67
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:10,440
# 调色 调味 调鲜 去膻
Coloring, Seasoning, Getting rid of the gamey taste

68
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,800
# 按道理如果说 羊肉大葱馅的
Normally, if we make the stuffing with lamb and leek

69
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,160
# 这个肉馅就有点硬
This texture would be too hard

70
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,720
# 我们就得加点花椒水
We need to add more Sichuan pepper steeped water

71
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,480
# 打上劲以后再加
Add the water after it has beaten enough

72
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,000
# 白菜馅我们就不加了
We won’t add more water to this stuffing with Napa cabbage

73
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,320
# 白菜也不用杀水 正合适
We don’t need to extract water from the Napa cabbage as well

74
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:33,760
# 大葱 姜 姜不要太多
Leek, not too much ginger

75
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,040
# 你看一抓 正合适
Grab it, the texture is just right

76
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,160
# 有时候看这盐看哪儿呢
Sometimes when we want to know if we need more salt

77
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,720
# 你看这白菜下去
You can see the cabbage is shrinking

78
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,720
# 待会它就塌下去了
It will sink later

79
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,360
# 说明这个盐就到位了
Which means we have enough salt

80
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,640
# 如果说半天这白菜还没下去
If the cabbage isn’t shrinking after a while

81
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,920
# 说明这咸味不够 这咸味差多了
Means it’s way not salty enough.

82
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:58,000
# 看着啊 拿手一抓
Look, I’m grabbing it with hands

83
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,760
# 这用羊肉做白菜馅儿的还真不多
It’s not common to use napa cabbage in lamb stuffing

84
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,040
# 大葱的多 但是搁点白菜
Mostly pairs up with leek, but add some napa cabbage

85
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,360
# 它煮出来以后白菜特别容易烂
After it boiled, the napa cabbage is really easy to become mushy

86
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,640
# 我得先闻闻这味
I’m going to smell it

87
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,000
# 还没搁香油呢
We haven’t added the sesame oil

88
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,360
# 等会儿搁上香油就香了
It’s going to smell really good after adding the sesame oil

89
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,640
# 香油
Sesame oil

90
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,880
# 这就是炸的料油
This is Liao You (the oil fried with many ingredients)

91
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,680
# 葱姜 适当再加点小茴香大料就行了
Scallions, ginger, and some fennel and star anise

92
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,240
# 肉馅儿特别肥就不用加油了
If the stuffing is very fat, there is no need for extra oil

93
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:26,120
# 少加 香油肯定是要加的
Don't add too much. Sesame oil is a must

94
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,320
# 油加完这馅儿特别润
The stuffing is moist after adding the oil

95
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,120
# 现在基本都是油打馅 好了
Now we all use oil in the stuffing. Done

96
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,840
# 二伯 面饧好了 看着啊
Er Bai, the dough is rested. Watch closely.

97
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,520
# 这回光滑了 开始包
It’s smooth now. Time to make the dumplings

98
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,200
# 看这羊肉馅还挺新鲜
The lamb stuffing is pretty fresh

99
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:44,360
# 这羊肉不错 不错吧 新鲜啊
This lamb is good. Right? It’s fresh.

100
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,920
# 煮饺子有一小窍门 搁点盐
Here is a tip for boiling the dumplings. Add some salt

101
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,960
# 这干嘛使呢 防止饺子出锅它粘
Why is that? In case the dumplings stick together out of the pot

102
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,760
# 防止它互相粘连 这就不粘了
In case they stick together. Now they won’t.

103
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:57,200
# 煮饺子得隆重 瞧着啊
Boiling dumplings need to be ceremonious. Look at it.

104
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:02,680
# 隋坡知道 因为所以 它不粘了
Sui Po knows. Because of the salt, they won’t stick.

105
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,640
# 往里面一推 理论家
Give them a little push. Theorists.

106
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,680
# 咱这锅大点多煮点
We can boil more with such a big pot

107
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,000
# 到时候粘成一锅了 不会的
What if they stick together. No, they won’t.

108
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,240
# 粘成一锅那就是片儿汤汆丸子
If they do, then it’s sliced dough soup with boiled meatballs.

109
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,960
# 煮饺子我们是这样
Here’s what we do when we boil the dumplings

110
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,680
# 顺着锅边 把这水给轰起来
Spin the water alongside the pot

111
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,840

112
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,960
# 旋转
Spin

113
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,440

114
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,960
# 开锅是煮馅 闭锅煮皮儿 为什么
Open-lid is to cook the stuffing, close-lid is to cook the dough wrap. Why

115
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:33,360
# 因为饺子在水里漂着 漂着的时候
Because when the dumplings flow in the water

116
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,360
# 它有上半拉皮是在水外边
Half of the wrap is flowing on the water

117
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,800
# 所以要盖上盖儿
So we need to close the lid

118
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,200
# 等皮儿就要快熟了
When the wrap is almost cooked

119
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,000
# 我们开始煮馅了 就得开着锅
We start to cook the stuffing with open-lid

120
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,600
# 如果再捂 就容易把饺子煮烂了
If we keep the lid close, the dumplings would break apart

121
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,200
# 皮儿就糟了
The wrap would be terrible

122
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:51,080
# 锅开了
The water is boiling

123
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:54,240
# 你看锅开大了 加点水
When you see the water boils, add some water

124
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,920
# 一是给它降降温
Firstly, it will cool done the temperature

125
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:00,280
# 二呢补充一点水分
Secondly, it will add more water

126
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,840
# 待会我们煮第二波
When we boil the second batch later

127
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,080
# 这水不会乱 不会黏糊
The water will not be messy and sticky

128
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:08,160
# 蒜泥 搁点醋 米醋
Minced garlic, add some vinegar, rice vinegar

129
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,920
# 在北京吃饺子一定要是吃米醋的
You have to dip rice vinegar when you eat dumplings in Beijing

130
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:16,840
# 少来点香油 香油多了它就不香
Add little sesame oil. Too much sesame oil will make it less tasty

131
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,520
# 这饺子煮到什么程度了你看
Let’s find out how’s the dumplings now

132
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:22,520
# 全鼓起来 鼓的跟小泡儿似的
All puff up, like small bubbles

133
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,240
# 起鼓不说了 还透亮呢
Not only puffs up but also lucency

134
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,760
# 摸摸 一按熟了
Give it a touch, it’s cooked

135
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:31,760
# 这个馅儿硬了 硬了就熟了
The stuffing is hard. Once it’s hardened, it’s cooked

136
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,920
# 好 捞了
Ok, scoop them out

137
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,520
# 来 照相
Time for photoes

138
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,120
# 这大饺子 饺子出锅啦
The dumplings are fresh out of the pot, looks delicious

139
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:39,920

140
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,000
# 肉馅你看都成团了
The suffering is shaped like a ball

141
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,800
# 有汤吗 有汤你看
