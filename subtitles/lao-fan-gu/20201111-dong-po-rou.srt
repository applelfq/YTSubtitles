Very important step here this is,

11
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,600
# 一个是把毛燎了 另外还去腥

12
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,080
# 火燎可以 把锅烧热了蹭一蹭也可以
Do it with direct flame (or blow torch), or just rub the skin on a smoking hot pan

13
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,080
# 火燎会更好
But it's better to just torch it

14
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,320
# 火苗的外边温度
Cuz the out rim of the flame is slightly hotter than the pan

15
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,040
# 要比锅里温度稍微高一些

00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,600
# 燎的非常的干净

# 会变成那种黄颜色
The pork will change to yellow

21
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,800
# 而且烧完黄之后 然后一刮

22
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,560
# 还便于吸收汤汁当中的颜色

51
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,120
# 那么用筷子你扎的时候是扎不动的

52
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,240
# 扎不动的肯定是不熟
meaning it's not cooked.

53
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,440
# 那么还有一种情况下

00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,200
# 扎完之后它会冒白水

56
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,480
# 一定是扎进之后拔出来

# 煮的过程当中 它的肌肉会收缩了
The muscle will contract in the boiling process, so that it won't curl again later

72
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,080

105
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,600
# 火一大特别容易粘
The meat will stick and burn if you turn the heat too high,

Boil it with high heat

114
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,040
# 烧完之后 肉皮当中的胶原蛋白

115
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,520
# 会把颜色吸进去 然后就关小火
Once the meat picks up good colour, turn the heat to low

00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:05,880
# 如果要是选五花的中部这一块
The mid portion of the belly is ideal,

125
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,520
# 还是非常好的 因为它肥瘦相间
there's a nice balance between lean and fat

126
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,600
# 如果是靠下边比如软那层五花
If you use the fattier part, it will fall apart

127
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,360
# 夹起来以后它会很散掉
it is easy to fall apart

128
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,680
# 但是硬的五块肉这地方
While if you use this tougher part (closer to loin),

129
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,720
# 它熟了之后它是紧致的
It is firmer when cooked.

130
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,920
# 所以是不一样的
See the difference? So you want to pick the tougher cut when choosing your belly.

131
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,080
# 选肉的时候是要用硬五花
So you want to pick the tougher cut when choosing your belly.

How long in the pressure cooker though?

138
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,560
# 四十分钟正合适
45 minutes will do.

139
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,920

140
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:41,440
# 肉好了 筷子轻轻一捅就进去了
See the meat is ready, the chopstick goes through just like  that

141
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,960
# 不费劲
Effortless.

142
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,200
# 行了别捅了 一会全是扎的眼儿了
Enough poking, pal. Holes are all over the place

143
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,720
# 把肉捞到一个地方
Take the meat out

144
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,560
# 篦一下 把渣子篦出去
Strain the liquid

145
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,880
# 汤里边的葱姜都要捡出去
Get rid of the ginger, green onion

146
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:57,280
# 这会皮就不能朝下 一定要朝上了
Now, Remember to keep the skin side up.

147
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,680
# 翻过来 开始收汁了
And start to reduce the sauce

148
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,160
# 大火收汁 收到剩一半
On high heat, reduce half of the liquid

149
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,880
# 现在这个原料 它的猪皮比较薄
Cuz the skin is kinda thin, not enough collagen's cooked out

150
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,520
# 含胶原蛋白比较少
Cuz the skin is kinda thin, not enough collagen's cooked out

151
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,440
# 所以汤汁的粘稠度还是达不到
the sauce is not as sticky

152
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,360
# 所以一会儿我们收汁的时候
So when we reduce the sauce,

153
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,040
# 还要适当勾点芡
we need to use a bit of slurry!

154
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,680
# 这味道不错 味道好极了
That's good taste!

155
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,480
# 咱们做东坡肉的过程当中
In the braising process

156
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,120
# 因为经过加热挥发
due to the heating and evaporation, 

157
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,760
# 咱们里边酒香味已经不够了
the aroma of cooking wine is not enough.

158
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:31,760
# 所以我们要补上一部分 再滚一下
So we add some to compensate, then boil for another while

159
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,400

160
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,840
# 把肉先起出来
Take out the meat, plate it

161
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:37,960

162
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:49,480
# 装好盘了 勾点芡啊 增加粘稠度
Some slurry in, thick up the sauce

163
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,760
# 边倒边搅 别着急
Stir while pouring, don't rush

164
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,240
# 慢慢让它糊化
Let it thicken.

165
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,200
# 锅下边看它慢慢起了小泡泡
You see it's bubbling at the bottom,

166
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,680
# 证明它已经开始慢慢糊化 温度够了
meaning it's thickening up

167
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,000

168
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,520
# 一次倒多了就够呛 就成咕嘟了
It'd be a disaster if you pour it all in.

169
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,200

170
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,560
# 没问题
Voilà,

171
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,560

172
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,800
# 来一点明油
a bit of scallion oil

173
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,280

174
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,320
# 关火
Off the heat.

175
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,920

176
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,200
# 红亮
Look at the red shine meat!

177
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,040
# 东坡肉
This IS Dongpo pork

178
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,760
# 下力一压 散了都
Even falls apart like this

179
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:24,920
# 火候正合适 恰到好处
Right on point.

180
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:28,240
# 看这个 空心馒头
Here, with some "flat" Mantou (aka Chinese steamed buns)

181
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,400
# 吃起来肥而不腻入口即化
It's light in texture and melts in mouth.

182
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,040
# 二伯
Er Bai. come on

183
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,120
# 大爷爱吃肥的 肥的入口即化
Da Ye like it fat, it melts

184
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,040
# 大爷后边的牙齿有点毛病
Da Ye cannot chew lean meat with his back teeth.

185
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:42,320
# 这牙吃瘦吃不了 只能吃肥的
can only chew the fat part.

186
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,320

187
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,640
# 好几天没吃这么香的肉了
It's been a while since last eaten meat this good.

188
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,840
# 到这才叫大爷呢
Way to go Da Ye!

189
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,000
# 其实这个肉
Actually, it'd be more flavourful, if we don't use the pressure cooker

190
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,720
# 要在原锅里边炖一个半小时的话
and just stew it for 90 minutes

191
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,280
# 这肉就更香
The meat will be more fragrant. 

192
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,640
# 但是我们为了节省时间
But we used pressure cooker, to save some time

193
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,480
# 放到高压锅里头
But we used pressure cooker, to save some time

194
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,120
# 应该说效果也不错
the result's not bad!

195
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,760
# 二伯 再不尝就凉了
Er Bai, taste it now bro.

196
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,080
# 接着锅尝
just use the pot as your bowl
197
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,640
# 带着空心馒头
have it with flat Mantou

198
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,960
# 我就不一一说了
I am not going to details

199
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,440
# 说点关键的
directly summarize it

200

# 隋坡掌握的是完全面面俱到

# 他一切的调料都是

00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,680
# 你看有的人就吃料味 他不是

208
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:45,000
# 就一个大料就烧出满满的香气味
One simple use of star anise brought out so much flavour

209
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,120

216
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,480
# 所以说隋坡对被烹饪的理解
Sui Po's understanding of cooking

217
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,960
# 和他掌握的这种技巧
