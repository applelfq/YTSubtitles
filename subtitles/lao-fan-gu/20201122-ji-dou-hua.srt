# 水开了 也得搅起来 关键点
The water is boiling. We need to stir here! This is a key point

5
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,040
# 国宴鸡豆花 这菜还真有难度
State Banquet - Ji Douhua (Chicken tofu pudding). This dish is difficult indeed

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,760
# 作为您来讲是不难啊
It's not difficult for you

7
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:16,040
# 大爷这个还真难
Da Ye, this one is indeed difficult

8
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:16,920

9
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,360

10
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:23,120

11
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:27,440
# 鸡牙子 这里面有个筋膜我给它登出去
'Ji Ya Zi'. Let me remove the fascia here

12
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,920
# 鸡胸里边最嫩的一块肉
The most tender cut in the chicken breast

13
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,880
# 就那么两块 一个鸡
You can only find two pieces of this in one chicken

14
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:37,160
# 这道菜是川菜里边一个代表菜
This is a representative dish in Sichuan cuisines

15
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:39,080
# 从豆花演变而来
It evolved from tofu pudding

16
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:42,040
# 形容它特别嫩 跟豆花似的
Because it is extremely tender, just like tofu pudding

17
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,040
# 它所谓的难渡过去没有机器
The difficult part is... there was no machine in the past

18
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,560
# 过去就得这样砸
So we needed to pound it like this

19
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,240
# 它剁的那筋就进去了
If you chop it, the fascia will be mixed into the meat

20
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,680
# 你看它砸 砸着砸着这膜
Look. As I pound it, the fascia...

21
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,640
# 你看它能砸出来 是不是大爷您看
See? It comes out. Right, Da Ye?

22
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,800
# 别砸了 有机器咱使机器吧
Don't pound it for now. We have the machine

23
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,040
# 过去用刀背砸
We used to pound the meat with the back of the cleaver

24
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,200
# 所以砸的需要一个时间
So it needs to be hit for a certain period

25
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,160
# 砸的越细越好 一个小时
The finer, the better. One hour of pounding

26
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,680
# 所以它有一定的难度 使机器吧
So it is difficult to make this dish

27
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,480
# 这个菜要比例不好 出来就非常老了
The dish will not be tender at all if you use the wrong ratio

28
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,960
# 一斤鸡牙子 水是四百克
For 500 grams of 'Ji Ya Zi', you'll need 400 grams of water

29
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:15,360
# 加的是葱姜酒水
We are adding the mixture of green onion, ginger, cooking wine, and water

30
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,760
# 要分几步 因为这机器小
You need to separate this step into several times because this machine is small

31
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,960

32
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,320
# 倒出来 这好
Pour it out. Good

33
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,520
# 这样就行
This is ok

34
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,960
# 五克盐
5 grams of salt

35
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,360
# 一百五十克蛋清 跟淀粉和在一块
150 grams of egg white, mixed with starch

36
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,400
# 鹰粟粉 鹰粟粉九十克
'Ying Su Fen' (corn starch). 90 grams

37
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,040
# 鹰粟粉也是淀粉的一种
It is also one type of starch

38
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,480
# 比较白比较细腻
It's white and smooth

39
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,560
# 鸡蛋清跟鹰粟粉和匀了
Mix the egg white with the corn starch

40
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,600
# 跟鸡豆花和好了
And the chicken paste

41
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,680
# 60目箩
60-mesh filter

42
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,480
# 60目的箩过一下 别剌手啊师父
Filter it with a 60-mesh filter. Be careful with your hand, master

43
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:51,000
# 过箩就使鸡蓉更加细腻
The filtering step makes the chicken paste more smooth

44
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,960
# 出来这个口感滑嫩
The texture will be silky and tender when cooked

45
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,080
# 你要是粗箩
If you are using a filter with larger mesh size

46
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:58,240
# 它出来以后有渣子 显得糙一点
There will be sediments remaining after filtering

47
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:03,400
# 所以这个箩的目数一定要比较精准
Hence you must be careful with the mesh size

48
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:07,480
# 细的就是60目 再粗一点就是40目
Fine mesh size means 60-mesh. A cruder one would be 40-mesh

49
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:14,120
# 过箩的时候要摁着 手放平
Press it when filtering. Place your hands horizontally

50
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,600
# 你看就下去了
See? It's going down

51
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,600
# 您看还不费劲 全下去了
It's not very hard. All going down

52
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,280
# 您这地道啊大爷
That's authentic, Da Ye

53
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,360
# 冲箩不能用热水冲
Don't wash the filter with hot water

54
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,160
# 好了 我现在可以吊（汤）了
Okay. Now I can prepare the broth

55
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,800
# 鸡胸肉鸡里脊都行
Chicken breast or chicken tenderloin

56
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,520
# 弄一个这汤料的扫子
Let's make a 'Sao Zi' (chopped chicken) for the broth

57
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,000
# 看着啊二伯有高招
Look. Er Bai has a great trick

58
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,600
# 我们在家里头
When cooking at home

59
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,760
# 如果来不及熬鸡汤
If you don't have enough time to prepare the broth

60
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,000
# 你说熬个鸡汤熬好几个小时
For example, you may think it is hard

61
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,720
# 有点困难
to spend several hours on cooking the chicken broth

62
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,000
# 我可以用点鸡胸肉 鸡里脊肉
You can use some chicken breast, or chicken tenderloin

63
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
# 直接剁 砸这个就不用很细了
Chop it directly. You don't need to chop it as careful as in the previous step

64
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,520
# 就是拿刀背砸一砸 成一种网状
Just pound it with the back of the cleaver. Make it look like a 'net'

65
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,320
# 到时候我们坐一锅开水
Then you can boil a pot of water

66
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:58,520
# 把砸好的粗的鸡蓉 下锅一扫
And simply put the crude chopped chicken into the pot

67
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:02,200
# 这汤就特别鲜了
The soup will be very delicious

00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,840

00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,000

# 看着啊这汤
Look at the broth

79
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:34,440
# 如果是我们熬的鸡汤 它是浑的
If we are preparing the chicken broth by long-time boiling, it's gonna be turbid

80
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,760
# 它会把鸡汤里边那些杂质
(The chopped chicken) will absorb the

81
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,440
# 通过它的旋转收缩
scums and impurities in the broth

82
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,000
# 就吸收到这鸡蓉身上
by swirling and shrinking

83
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,800
# 尤其我们很多网友
Especially when you need to cook in a short time

84
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,360
# 有时候临时来个任务 吊汤来不及啊

85

# 这一下我们用这种方法
Now we use this method

00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,840
# 然后这鸡蓉在加热和成熟的瞬间
The chopped chicken will float onto the surface

90
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,200
# 它会浮起来
when it's heated and cooked

91
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,680
# 我们把肉里边出现的这些沫子
Now we need to completely

92
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,840
# 要把它打干净
remove the scums

93
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,800
# 然后再进行扫第二遍
Now let's clean the broth again

# 连鸡蓉都没有
Not even chopped chicken

00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,840
# 反正我在家做饭
Well, when I am cooking at home

97
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,560
# 有时候哪儿有汤啊 就是水
Sometimes I may not have soup, but just water

98
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,560
# 但是煮个面就没味儿啊
but it will taste too bland if cooking noodles with water

99
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,320
# 卧俩鸡蛋 这个汤就鲜美了
In that case, add two eggs. The soup will be much better

100
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:27,120
# 大家看这汤这水越来越清亮了
See? The soup is becoming more clear and transparent

101
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,280
# 而且还有一点淡淡的绿茶的茶色
Also it comes with a slight green tea color

102
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,960

Every time you add the chopped chicken into the broth, it becomes clearer

105
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,200
# 小魏赶紧 关小火么 关一点
-Xiao Wei, hurry up! -Lower the heat? -Yes

106
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,360
# 一翻了锅就完蛋
It'll be spoiled if it's boiling

107
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,600
# 好 倒里面
Okay. Pour it in

108
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,880
# 继续转 旋转
Keep it swirling

109
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,760

# 先别理它 先让它收缩沉淀

# 它就浮起来了
It'll float

112
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,960

# 你看 漂起来了 翻起来了
See? It's floating

114
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,120
# 有时候我们为了汤好看
Sometimes for the appearance of the broth

115
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,400
# 加一些红扫
We use some red meat

116
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,920
# 比如牛肉扫 红的香
For example, chopped beef. Red meat makes the soup more aromatic

117
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,440
# 鸡是鲜
Chicken enhances the umami flavor

118
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,960
# 这时候加盐
Now add salt

119
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,880
# 最着急的是这一瞬间
This is the most nervous moment

120
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,200
# 这个锅是复合底的 上热上的慢
This pot has a complex bottom. The heat goes up slowly

121
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,120
# 而且这还不能大锅滚
You cannot use high heat to boil the broth

122
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,960
# 一滚就翻乱了
The broth will be bad if you boil it violently

123
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,960
# 只要开锅 它不能翻锅
It has to reach the temperature, but not boiling

124
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,680
# 只要一开就得使小火 让它微着开
When it starts to boil, turn to low heat and let it boil slowly

125
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,800
# 你看这一锅吊一小时以后
If you boil one pot of broth for one hour

126
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,880
# 就成半锅了
It'll become half a pot

127
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:31,080
# 把鸡蓉的味全吊出来了
The flavor of chopped chicken will be driven out completely

128
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,360
# 那时候是最好的了 你知道吗
That's the best cooking time, you know?

129
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,560
# 看啊 要开 关小火了
Look. It's going to boil. Now turn to low heat

130
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,480
# 现在稍微小一点了
Just a little bit less heat

131
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,920
# 还得让它出沫
We still need to wait for all scum to come out

132
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,000
# 有的网友说 什么叫砸一下
Some friends asked, what is 'Za' (literally knock) the broth?

133
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,120
# 这个时候有的这火 调不了那么小
Sometimes you may not be able to use a low-enough heat level

134
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,440
# 这汤开的又挺大
And the broth is boiling violently

135
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:53,280
# 我们有时候来一点凉水 一砸
You may add some cold water rapidly into the pot

136
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,040
# 等它再一开又有沫子
When it boils again, more scum will come out

137
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,200
# 如果你不砸它一下
If you don't add some cold water

138
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,640
# 这沫子就翻进去了
The scum will go back into the broth

139
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:00,240
# 哦了 关火
That's ok. Turn off the heat

140
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,600
# 汤一凉的时候 一会它就沉底儿了
The chicken will sink to the bottom when it cools down

141
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,600
# 这时候加味 加盐
Now season it. Add some salt

142
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,040
# 你看 这就特别好看了
Now it looks great

143
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,560
# 这就是快速的鸡汤
This is the instant chicken broth

144
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,920
# 如果燉半个小时
If you boil it for half an hour

145
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:17,320
# 鸡肉的味道完全吊出来了 特别鲜
The flavor of chicken goes into the broth completely, rendering it with extreme umami flavor

146
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,120
# 所以这个鲜度足够了
The umami flavor is enough now

147
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,200
# 开始做鸡豆花
Let's cook chicken tofu pudding now

148
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,680
# 好第二步啊
Ok. Second step

149
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,280
# 这一杯水啊 混合完了
Now add this cup of water

150
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,080
# 我这慢慢的
Slowly

151
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,560
# 一点一点的让它打进去
Slowly mix it with the slurry chicken paste

152
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:29,960
# 原来四百克（水）
We added 400 grams of water previously

153
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,800
# 这又加了二百五十克（水）
Now we add 250 grams more

154
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,120
# 六百五十克（水）
In total, 650 grams of water

155
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,400
# 之前不能加
We shouldn't add it in the previous step

156
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,800
# 就跟大爷打这个狮子头似的
Just like when Da Ye cooks 'Shi Zi Tou'

157
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,800
# 一下加足了它就完了
The dish will be a failure if you add water in one go

158
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,680
# 这就是难度
This is the difficult part

159
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,920
# 这差不多吧大爷 这差不多了
-What about this, Da Ye? -It's ok

160
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:48,240
# 水开了 给它搅起来
The water is boiling. We need to stir it!

161
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,440
# 大火啊关键点
Use high heat. That's a key point!

162
00:06:52,440 --> 00:07:01,560

163
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,640
# 成功
Success

164
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,520
# 是大火啊这会
High heat now

165
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,240
# 我让它开了之后
When it boils

166
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:14,240
# 稍微一开就赶紧小火十分钟
As soon as it boils, turn to low heat and wait for 10 minutes

167
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,760
# 就别理它了
Now leave it alone

168
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,400
# 看它的变化
See how it changes

169
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:23,760
# 这让网友学真的这还真有难度
It's really difficult for our audience to practice this dish by themselves

170
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,960
# 没说嘛简单的事情 不简单啊
Well a simple thing may not be as simple as it looks

171
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,160
# 让它不能开了
Don't let it boil

172
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,680
# 就跟煮那汤似的别让它开了
Just like when boiling the broth... Don't let it boil

173
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:34,960
# 小火不能开啊 不能开锅
Low heat. No boiling!

174
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,920
# 小火似开非开那样
Use low heat and make it somewhere between boiling and not boiling

175
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,960
# 不用搅和
Do we need to stir it?

176
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,920
# 这不能再搅了再搅就散了
No. It'll fall apart if you disturb it

177
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,120
# 你给大爷拿个凳子让大爷坐会
Get a chair for Da Ye and let him sit for a while

178
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,800
# 没事没事我这观察着呢
It's fine. I'm looking at the pot

179
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,920
# 火不到它不抱团
If the temperature is not high enough, the 'tofu pudding' will not aggregate

180
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,440
# 只要全浮起来就ok了
It's done when everything is floating

181
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,320
# 小火慢慢成熟
Let it cook slowly with low heat

182
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,000
# 有八到十分钟就可以了
Leave it for 8 to 10 minutes

183
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,840
# 这让它都得飞出来
We need to remove all the scum

184
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,120
# 就让它似开非开就行了
Let it boil, but not boiling

185
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,520
# 这鸡汤吊着也差不多了
The chicken broth is almost done

186
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,320
# 这也成熟了
This is also done

187
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,600
# 就把这加了热之后
Let's heat the broth

188
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,720

189
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,160
# 温度够就行了
As long as the temperature is high enough

190
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:23,680
# 这个可以了 这还真差不多了
-This is done. -Yes

191
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,520
# 拿一个漏勺往出盛吧
Get a skimmer to take it out

192
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,320
# 好可以了
Okay. This is ready

193
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,080
# 先盛鸡汤 别攉拢
Get the chicken broth first. Don't disturb it

194
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,440
# 就盛浮头的 攉拢浮起来就下不去了
Take the supernatant. If you disturb it, the scums will never sink again

195
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,080
# 清鸡汤
Clear chicken broth

196
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:39,000
# 这汤漂亮 香味也往上飘 可以了
This broth looks awesome. Smells great as well. Okay

197
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,080
# 搁这
Put it here

198
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,640
# 跟这边上起 少拢少拢
Raise it from the edge. Take less

199
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,640

200
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,920
# 拿这水（清鸡汤）稍微淋它一下
Rinse it (with the broth) a bit

201
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,040
# 把这上面的浮沫就淋下去了
Such that the scum over it will be removed

202
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,080

203
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,840
# 跟这儿抹进去 抹
Put it in gently. Gently

204
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,640

205
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,160

Gently. Don't disturb it

206
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,280
# 热的沉不了底
It's hot and it won't sink

207
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,120
# 为什么说要人家要蒸的
Why some people tend to steam it?

208
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,000
# 人家上宴会为什么蒸啊
Why steam this dish in the banquet?

209
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,400
# 就让它浮在面儿上 关火
Steaming will make the tofu pudding float on the surface

210
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,960
# 国宴鸡豆花
State banquet Ji Douhua

211
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:18,800

# 因为这个菜 当第一次做的时候

# 而这个汤 要有清汤的良好的功底

# 这豆花 在方的配比上很严谨

224
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,240
# 一次次的我们纠正去改良
We have been correcting and improving this dish continuously

225
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,320
# 二伯 二十年都不干了
Er Bai has been away for his position for 20 years

226
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:07,720
# 所以说二十多年宝刀未老 老当益壮
but he is still good at it. He becomes better as he gets older

227
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,960
# 在大爷的帮助下
with Da Ye's help of course

228
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:12,000

# 八十度跟一百度

# 你呈现出来的东西就差远了
Makes a great difference on your dish

238
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,560
# 大爷你说是不是大爷
Isn't it, Da Ye?

239
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,840
# 为什么要蒸啊
Why steaming?

240
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,560
# 那个啤酒鸭那饺子
Remember the beer duck with dumplings

241
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,920
# 你要汤不热 那饺子是沉底的
If the soup is not hot enough, the dumplings will sink to the bottom

242
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,240
# 这重要的大型的细活啊 小魏
(The banquet is) important and large-scale, but requires great care

00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,280

245
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,280
# 十一点了啊
It's 11 pm now
