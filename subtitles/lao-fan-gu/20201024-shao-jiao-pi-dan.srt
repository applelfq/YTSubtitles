24
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,400

00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,040
# 也可以在锅里面去焙
That you can toast the chillies in the pan

43
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,760
# 锅里面什么都不放就干的 干焙
Just dry toast them without adding anything else

44
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,600
# 但是它没有这种燎的香
But the chillies wouldn’t be as fragrant as what we are getting here

45

You don’t need to remove them completely

51
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,040

52
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:11,240
