47
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,200
# 因为一搅又上劲了
The stirring will add more gluten then create a tough texture

48
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,360
# 这会咱沾点淀粉
First, put oysters in the starch

49

We need to settle the coat then re-fry it later

54
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,600
# 倍儿漂亮 金黄色
You see the beatiful golden color?

55
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
# 这时候脆皮糊就稍微加点水
Now we need to add some water into the batter

# 稀释点 薄薄的一层糊
To make it thinner, a thin batter

57
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,720
# 要不然太厚了不好看了
Or else the coat will be too thick and heavy

58
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,880
# 紫苏叶必须得炸 炸完了之后垫底
Perilla leaves also need to be fried then put on the bottom of the plate

59
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:24,920

# 牡蛎回一下锅
Let re-fty the oysters one more time in a high temperature

00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,240
# 油温最少是八成热
The oil temperature should be at least 250 celsius now

83
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:26,400
# 因为过去有些原材料不是那么很好
Because back then, the quality of some ingredients was not that good

84
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,840
# 也不是很新鲜

00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,360
# 师父您尝尝这个菜行不行

86
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,400
# 一尝不够鲜
Master felt that the umami flavor was not strong enough

87

# 师父到味精罐儿里头捏点味精
Master pitched some MSG 

88
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,520
# 往这菜里边一扔 行了

# 所以师父是什么 师父是味精
So, Master is like MSG
