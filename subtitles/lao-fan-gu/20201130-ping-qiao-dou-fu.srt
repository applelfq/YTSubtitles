# 简介

# 小友们好，隋坡师傅上次带来的文思豆腐大家都还有印象吗？
# 视频链接：https://youtu.be/HD3s_AyY7Ug
# 那条视频收到很多朋友反馈，说文思豆腐刀功太难了，这次就给大家带来一道刀功更加简单的菜品，也是一道淮扬名菜，切出来的豆腐形似小雀舌，搭配蛋皮、香菇、虾干和鸡肉，咸鲜味美、清素入肺、顺滑细腻，令乾隆都拍手叫绝！
# 这次我们用的高汤是老饭骨的金汤，滋味醇厚并且方便快捷，小友们有需要可以在老饭骨淘宝购买！
# Hi friends! Do you remember the Wensi Tofu introduced by Po Sui?
# Link to the video: https://youtu.be/HD3s_AyY7Ug
# Many feedback from that video said it required too many knife skills. This time we will introduce one with fewer knife skills needed. A famous Huaiyang cuisine. The sliced tofu looks like the tongue of sparrow. Accompanied by egg roll wrapper, shiitake, dried shrimp and chicken. Savory, light, sliky and smooth.
# This time we used the golden stock from Lao Fan Gu as the stock. Thick, rich flavor with easy usage. You can buy it in Lao Fan Gu's Taobao shop!
