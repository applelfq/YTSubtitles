48
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,640

When the pork feet are being cooked in pressure cooker,

85
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,560
# 这芸豆您就关火闷着就行了
you can stop the heat for the kidney beans, put the lid on and let the residual heat further cook itself.

86
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,040
# 其实要自己家里吃 就没这么复杂了
Actually it can be simpler with a homemade version.

87
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,200
# 连这猪手剁好了之后
You can just chop the pork feet,

88
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:50,240

Later when it’s cooked by the pressure cooker,

94
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,360
# 应该是当归的味在前对吧 对

One chop easily splits it into two.

113
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,240
