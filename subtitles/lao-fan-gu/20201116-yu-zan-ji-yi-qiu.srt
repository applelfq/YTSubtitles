# State Banquet Master Chef: Yu Zan Ji Yi Qiu (Jade hairpin chicken wing)

# 简介

# 小友们大家好，今天大爷给大家带来一道小炒菜品——玉簪鸡翼球！
# 玉簪鸡翼球的造型很别致，鸡翼中插入青椒和胡萝卜，一红一绿，活像一根玉簪子！
# 这道菜原本是粤菜的一道老菜，大爷在味型上进行了改良，做成了宫保味儿，香辣酥麻、更加突出鸡翼的肉质细嫩。炒的时候满屋子的人都得在打喷嚏，不然炒得不合格！ 😁
# 大家还记得老饭骨做过哪些鸡肉的菜品呢？评论区一起回忆一下，还想解锁更多鸡肉的做法，记得要关注老饭骨频道哦！
# Hello friends! Today Da Ye will show you a stir-fried dish: Yu Zan Ji Yi Qiu (Jade hairpin chicken wing)!
# The shape of the chicken wing is very special. With green chili and carrot inserted into the chicken wing section, it looks just like a jade hairpin!
# It was originally a traditional Cantonese dish. Da Ye has modified the flavor of this dish - he cooks it in the 'Kung Pao' flavor: aromatic, spicy, crispy, numbing, with the extra presentation of the tenderness of the chicken wing. Everyone was sneezing during cooking; otherwise this dish would be a failure!

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,520
# 炒出来这菜您不打嚏喷我就失败了
It would be a failure if you don't sneeze when I am cooking

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:04,560

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,240
# 烹醋 老的宫保鸡丁的味道
Add vinegar. The old flavor of Kung Pao Chicken

4
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:10,640
# 这是粤菜的一道老菜 味型改了
This is a traditional Cantonese dish. I adjusted its flavor

5
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,320

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,240

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,160
# 鸡翅 这个不能扔啊 做个辣子鸡
-Chicken wing. -Don't throw this away, we can still cook 'La Zi Ji' (spicy chicken) out of it!

8
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,400

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,960
# 一拍 这两根骨头全断了
Knock it. Both bones will break

10
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:29,160
# 看着啊 一压 一个一个的来
Watch this. Press it, one by one

11
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,560

12
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:36,080
# 先把这留着 然后再去那块
Keep this part first. Then remove it

13
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,480
# 能拿住它
(In this way) you can hold the chicken wing

14
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,720
# 大爷 那个真别糟蹋
Da Ye, don't waste that

15
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:43,120
# 绝对糟蹋不了 那个单做出一菜来
I won't of course! We can make a dish out of it

16
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,320
# 做一蒸的吧  蒸的好 豆豉蒸
What about steaming it? Good idea, steam it with "Douchi" fermented soybeans

17
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,280
# 这徒弟脑瓜灵啊 师父一直在念叨呢
What a brilliant disciple! Your master has always been talking about you

18
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,800
# 隋坡不来我恨死他了
like 'Sui Po doesn't come. I don't like him!' #这里认真的翻译吗哈哈哈

19
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,160
# 为什么老不来啊
'Why is he always absent?'

20
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:57,320
# 花为媒 似的 你怎么还不来呀
Like in the opera Hua Wei Mei, 'why~aren't~you~here~yet~'

21
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,240
# 全算上刚十五分钟
It's just 15 minutes since we started

22
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,480
# 这就完事了 正合适
And it's done! Perfect time

23
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:05,480
# 青椒 长短要比刚才剔出去的骨头
Green chili. The piece should be slightly longer

24
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:10,480
# 要稍微长一点 来个鸡蛋
than the bone that we just removed. Give me an egg

25
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,040
# 你这一招一式还挺利落
That's a nice move

26
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,120
# 照这样你能干到九十岁都没问题
You can do this all the way to your 90s

27
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,800
# 九十岁之前不会歇厨了
You won't retire from the kitchen before your 90s

28
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,400
# 二伯 咱俩得永远在一起
Er Bai, we need to stick together forever

29
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,280
# 实在干不了了
If you are too old to cook

30
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,960
# 您剥葱剥蒜也得在这儿干
You still have to stay here, even you can only peel the green onions and garlics

31
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,120

32
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:27,320
# 上浆特别快 鸡蛋
Battering is very simple. Egg

33
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,080
# 因为咱们炒的是红汁菜
Since we are cooking a 'red sauce' dish

34
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,320
# 就用全鸡蛋
We can use whole eggs

35
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,880
# 必须要用蛋黄 因为它香
You must keep the yolk because it enhances the aroma

36
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,520
# 淀粉 大约十五克
Starch. About 15 grams

37
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,480
# 盐 三克 特别快啊
Salt. 3 grams. Very fast

38
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:42,760
# 鸡蛋蛋清 先把糊和好 攉拢匀了
Firstly, mix the batter uniformly

39
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,200
# 再给我来一点淀粉
Some more starch, please

40
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,200
# 半勺 好好
Half a spoon. That's enough!

41
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,600
# 这些淀粉用不完
We are not using it all

42
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,200
# 一会咱们再这点淀粉干别的用
Let's keep these for later use

43
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,040
# 好 拿走 十秒钟就完事了
Ok. Please take it away. It'll be done in 10 seconds

44
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:58,400
# 这盐搁好了 鸡蛋淀粉 叫搅拌上劲
We have added the salt already. Now mix the chicken with the egg-starch batter until you feel the resistance

45
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,840
# OK了 有劲了
That's OK. Now it feels resistant

46
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,040
# 二伯回手给来点油
Er Bai, please add some oil

47
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,320
# 封油 好嘞
Seal with oil. Done!

48
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,240

49
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:14,040
# 看着啊 现在开始串
Look. Now we start to insert the vegetables

50
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,920
# 为什么叫玉簪鸡翼球
Why is it called 'Jade hairpin chicken wing'?

51
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,480
# 就跟簪子似的 你看见没有
It looks just like a hairpin. See that?

52
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,720
# 为什么要用这两个颜色
Why are we using these two colors,

53
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,960
# 一红一绿 它漂亮
red and green? Because it looks beautiful

54
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:25,880
# 像不像簪子 再拿牙签咱串它一下
Looks like a hairpin, doesn't it? You can further stablize it with a toothpick

55
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,400
# 它掉不了 巧就巧在这儿了
It won't fall apart. That's the tricky point

56
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,720
# 一成熟鸡肉就收缩了
The chicken shrinks once cooked

57
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,400
# 这个可以炒
You can stir-fry the chicken wing here

58
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,000
# 如果我们串点萝卜或者藕条
If you use raddish and lotus instead

59
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,280
# 可以给它出下水 就变成白的了
You can blanch it. The chicken wing will look white

60
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,160
# 白汁的可以清炖
You can make a soup in that case

61
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:45,480
# 国宴过去讲 吃完冷菜上两个小炒
In previous state banquets, two stir-fried dishes were served after the cold starters

62
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,720
# 这两个小炒是什么菜呢
What are the stir-fried dishes for?

63
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,920
# 是要喝酒的菜
They allow guests to have a drink

64
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,200
# 上完小炒以后才上大菜
The main course was served after the stir-fried dishes

65
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,800
# 过去的菜单就这么安排的
That's how we arranged the menu

66
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,200
# 比如说上完七个冷菜
For example, after seven cold dishes

67
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,680
# 跟着上俩小炒
Two stir-fried dishes were served

68
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,680
# 什么干煸牛肉丝 什么炒银芽
Like dry-fried shredded beef, or stir-fried bean sprouts

69
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,240
# 那会儿过瘾啊大爷
That was the good old times, Da Ye

70
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,080
# 隋坡看见没有
See that, Sui Po?

71
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,520
# 切东西做东西做事儿要稳妥
You need to be careful whenever you cut things or cook dishes

72
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:10,080
# 稳妥在哪呢 有数
More specifially, you have everything clear in your mind

73
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,680
# 干活要有数
Keep everything organized in your mind

74
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,640
# 看着啊 就剩了两根 这就不算剩
See that? Just two left. That's nothing

75
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:19,760
# 好 洗手 心里有谱 有谱
Okay, let me wash my hand. -Keep a clear mind!

76
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,400

77
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,640
# 这下该下一小节目了啊
Now we proceed to our next show

78
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,040
# 咱们兑个碗汁
Let's make a bowl of sauce

79
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,040
# 酱油 米醋
Soybean sauce, rice vinegar

80
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,200
# 米醋一会还得烹点
We need to add some rice vinegar later

81
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:36,880
# 黄酒 盐 糖
Huangjiu rice wine, salt, and sugar

82
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,480
# 我这个叫碗汁不叫碗芡
This is 'bowl sauce', rather than 'bowl slurry sauce'

83
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,920
# 因为这里面没有淀粉
Because there's no starch here

84
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,800
# 要有淀粉叫碗芡
If there is, it's called 'bowl slurry sauce'

85
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,240
# 葱姜蒜小料 这就算齐活了
Minced green onion, ginger, and garlic. That's all we need

86
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,280

87
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,080
# 辣椒 还得洗一洗
We need to wash the chili

88
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,560
# 把辣椒籽要洗出去
and remove the seeds

89
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,480
# 锅烧好了 二伯给倒点油
The wok is heated. Er Bai, please add some oil

90
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,480
# 看啊 这花生米炸好了
See? The peanuts are fried

91
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,960
# 给它搞成花生碎
Now we crush them into pieces

92
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,520
# 花生碎也好了 油温也高了
Peanuts taken care of. The oil temperature is right

93
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,880
# 现在已经五成热了
Now it's about 150 degrees celsius

94
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,720

95
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,920
# 下锅
Into the wok

96
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,880

97
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:16,880
# 不要乱动它 为什么不让动啊
Don't disturb it too much. Why?

98
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,920
# 一定要给鸡肉在油中
That's because you need some time for the starch on the surface of the chicken

99
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:22,200
# 表面淀粉糊化成熟的一个时间
to be solidified

100
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,160
# 否则会粘的满锅都是
Otherwise it would be stuck everywhere in the wok

101
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,080
# 这多漂亮 一个都没掉
Look how beautiful this is. None of them fell apart

102
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,800
# 出锅 收缩就可以倒进去了
Out of the wok as soon as the chicken shrinks

103
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,120
# 花椒 这花椒有的师傅炒
Sichuan peppercorns. Some chefs tend to keep them in the dish

104
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,320
# 就搁在里边了 但吃起来很不舒服
But in that case, you may have some trouble eating the dish

105
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,200
# 还要把它捞干净
So we should remove the peppercorns now

106
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,880

107
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,640
# 你看我们这时候油温就很热
See? Now the oil temperature is very high

108
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,360
# 我为什么把辣椒给洗一下
That's why I washed the chili

109
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,040
# 这样的也会降低油温
This will help lowering the oil temperature as well

110
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,400

111
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,080
# 它不会马上糊
The chili does not get burnt soon

112
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,400
# 到现在都没糊
Not burnt yet

113
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,480
# 要不是拿水洗了 一下就糊了 完了
If the chili was not washed, it will be burnt immediately. That'll spoil the dish

114
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,840

115
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,120
# 葱姜
Green onion, ginger

116
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,760
# 糊辣味型的小料标配是葱姜蒜
The standard ingredients for this 'Hu La' (Slightly-burnt spicy) flavor are green onion, ginger, and garlic

117
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,080
# 对 小料的料头要狠
Yes. Add plenty of those

118
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,960
# 二伯 倒进来
Er Bai, put in the chicken in please

119
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,680
# 这个时候我们要搁点辣椒面
Now we add some chili pepper powder

120
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,680
# 辣椒面下去以后炒香
After adding the chili pepper powder, stir-fry until aromatic

121
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,480
# 碗汁儿
Add the bowl-sauce now

122
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,880

123
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,880
# 颜色很漂亮
Nice color

124
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,680
# 因为这个汁要是炒鸡丁
The sauce would be too much if we are cooking diced chicken

125
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,440
# 这汁儿就多了 有一半就够了
Half of this would be enough

126
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,000
# 勾芡  因为这个鸡球比较大
Add slurry. Since the chicken wing is relatively large

127
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,920
# 所以这个汁儿稍微大一点
So we have relatively more sauce here

128
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,840

129
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,640
# 好了
Okay

130
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,320
# 烹醋 提香
Add vinegar to enhance the aroma

131
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,160

132
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,120
# 花生碎
Crushed peanuts

133
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,480

134
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:44,520
# 您得打嚏喷或者打一咳嗽
You must be sneezing or coughing

135
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:48,920

136
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,560
# 炒出来这菜您不打嚏喷我就失败了
Otherwise this dish would be a failure

137
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,920
# 你好长时间没来了
You haven't come for a long time

138
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,960

139
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,840
# 谢谢师叔
Thank you, Er Bai!

140
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,520
# 照大爷 好吃啊这个
Look at Da Ye. This tastes great!

141
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:08,480
# 糊辣味十足 超级嫩
Full of 'Hu La' flavor. Super tender

142
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:12,360
# 特别嫩 太香了
Extremely tender. Smells awesome

143
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,720
# 改良之后有老的味道
You can taste the old flavors from this modified version

144
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,160
# 吃出老的宫保鸡丁的味道的时候
Apart from the old 'Kung Pao' flavor

145
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,440
# 还有蔬菜那种清香味
