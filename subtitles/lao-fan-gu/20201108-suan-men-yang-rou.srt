# 羊肉选择是很讲究的
You need to be picky when choosing lamb for this dish

9
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,800
# 你要是羔羊不行 它没那口感 太嫩
Young lamb is not appropriate. It's too tender

10
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,240
# 羊肉选的部位是羊腩或者是前腿
You may choose lamb belly or front leg

11
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:36,160
# 一年以上的羊肉炖出来好吃 筋道
Lamb over 1-year-old is more delicious, providing a chewy texture

12
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,040
# 刀工还挺整齐 刀工一致 齐活
-Nice cutting skill. -Nicely cut, done!

13
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,240
# 吃之前一定要有一个浸泡的过程
You must soak the meat before cooking

14
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,480
# 之前我已经给它浸泡了几个小时了

Let's wash it now

16

# 把这血水给它拔出来

00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:48,960
# 然后今天咱这个菜
Our dish today

18

# 就是前期处理的时候很关键
relies heavily on the preparation step

19
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:55,360
# 因为肉是冻卷 是冻肉
Since we are using frozen lamb now

20
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,880
# 进过冷库的羊肉一定要
Frozen lamb must be

21
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,240
# 在处理的时候要仔细一点
carefully processed before cooking

22
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,160
# 其实为什么内蒙羊肉好吃
To be honest, why is the best lamb in Inner Mongolia?

23
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,640
# 一般人就是现宰现炖
That's because they cook the lamb directly after butchering

24
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,560
# 这个羊肉 您要是鲜肉就不用这么复杂
If you have fresh lamb, you don't really need to do all these

25
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,640
# 就直接上水 就直接给它煮就行了加盐
Simply boil it in water with some salt

26
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,800
# 但是这肉一冻完了之后
But once the meat is frozen

27
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,320
# 它腥膻味就加重
The taint strengthens

28
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:20,200
# 因为血水在里面闷着
because the blood remains in the meat (when frozen)

29
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,960
# 现在通过这么多年的实践
Based on our practice for so many years

30
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,760
# 一个羊肉一个鸡就不能冻 还有鸽子
It's better not to freeze lamb and chicken. And pigeon

31
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,840
# 只要一冻就完
They taste bad once frozen

32
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,640
# 大家看一眼 肉一定要冲到水清了
Please take a look. You must rinse the meat until the water becomes clear

33
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,480
# 然后这时候咱们凉水下锅了
Now let's boil it with cold water

34
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,760
# 肉要是不清的话
If you don't rinse the meat well

35
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:39,480
# 说句实话吃的味道就差远了
To be honest, it tastes much worse

36
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,440
# 鲜肉您没必要
However this does not apply to fresh meat

37
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:43,000
# 鲜肉您你怎么煮它都是清的
Fresh meat always tastes nice no matter how you deal with it #这句话有点意味不明...

38
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,280
# 这肉筋头筋脑的好吃
This cut tastes good because it contains tendon

39
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,400
# 我觉得我每回吃
Personally, I would always prefer

40
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,440
# 都愿意吃羊腩那块 或者前腿
Lamb belly or front leg

41
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,920
# 羊腩牛腩这都好吃
Lamb belly and beef brisket taste good

42
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,640
# 趁这机会我先把大蒜切了
Let me cut the garlic now

43
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,640
# 活不能闲着是吧
We should make full use of our time, right?

44
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:04,040
# 咱们蒜量一定要大 有半斤多
We must use a lot of garlic in this dish. More than 250 grams here

45
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,320
# 中间给它破开就行 一切两半
Simply cut it in the middle. Cut into two halves

46
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,840
# 第一这样好出味
Firstly, the flavor goes out easily

47
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,840
# 第二就是说
Secondly

48
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,880
# 这个蒜 它的个儿不能大过主料去
The size of the garlic should not exceed the main ingredient (lamb)

49
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:15,240
# 这道菜最早我吃的时候是在西北吃的
I had this dish for the first time in the northwest of China

50
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,800
# 然后回来之后
After I came back

51
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,680
# 结合咱们北京这块的口味
Based on the preference of flavor in Beijing

52
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,400
# 又重新给做了一个调整
I adjusted the recipe of this dish

53
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,920
# 这个汤出来是奶白色的
In my recipe, the soup is milky white

54
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,760
# 我们在当地吃的时候是清汤的
Back into the northwest, the broth was clear and transparent

55
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,320
# 都是鲜羊 咱们比不了
(In the northwest) they have fresh lamb, which we don't have here

56
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,920
# 然后这个羊肉用咱们冻卷一试
So I tried with frozen lamb to make this dish

57
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,400
# 做出奶白汤来了 我说这菜有意思
I was surprised that we could make milky white soup with frozen lamb

58
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,000
# 这也没有这么多香料
Here I am not using many spices

59
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,280
# 不能把羊肉的味给它盖了
Because we should avoid covering the original flavor of lamb

60
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,960
# 以前就是说这汤你可以留原汤
In previous dishes, you can use the original broth here (for further steps)

61
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,520
# 但是今天咱们这个不能用
But we cannot use this today

62
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,120
# 今天咱要用纯净水
We are using purified water instead

63
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,960
# 亮子 我有我自己的看法
Liangzi, I have my own idea on this issue

64
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,840
# 我估计大爷能赞同我的看法
I think Da Ye agrees with me

65
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,960
# 比如说我要做清汤的这种羊肉
For example, if I am going to make a lamb dish with clear broth

66
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,560
# 就是炖的汤也不要
I would rather discard the broth out of lamb

67
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,960
# 完全换成吊好的清鸡汤
I would use clear chicken broth

68
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,680
# 然后它合成的时候
When the chicken broth meets lamb

69
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,000
# 汤巨鲜 肉特别香
The soup becomes incredibly nice, and the meat tastes amazing

70
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,080
# 大爷他们做狮子头慢慢也发展了
Da Ye is also making some changes in his Shizitou (aka 'Lion Head') recipe

71
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,440
# 原来就是原汤 现在换成清鸡汤
In the old recipe, he used the original broth. Now it's changed into clear chicken broth

72
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,800
# 要不然搁点菌汤
Or mushroom broth

73
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,520
# 它也在随着人的需求在发展了
The recipe keeps developing according to customers' demands

74
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:13,720
# 咱们店里边卖清鸡汤羊蝎子
In our restaurant, the 'Lamb spine with clear chicken broth'

75
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,000
# 一直反响特别好
has always a been popular dish

76
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,160
# 行了 这开锅就行了
Okay. It's done when boiling

77
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:21,720
# 因为你这是冷水下锅
Because you are boiling from cold water

78
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,560
# 您看刚才这个肉看着
See? You may think the lamb looks very fatty

79
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,160
# 是不是觉得特别肥
before boiling

80
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,320
# 你看这回做完了之后这个肉
Now take another look. The lamb...

81
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:33,040
# 羊腩这块肥瘦相间 筋也多
The lamb belly is composed of lean meat and fat. Also some tendons

82
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,960
# 就适合炖的 烧的
It's very suitable for braising and brewing

83
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,880
# 汤底一定要用纯净水
You must use bottled water for the soup

84
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,640
# 对用好水 这个不能将就
Yes, you should use good water. Cannot compromise on that

85
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,040
# 或者净化过的水也行
or purified water

86
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,440
# 大爷这个羊肉我试过什么您知道么
Da Ye, let me tell you what I tried with lamb

87
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,960
# 那时候八几年 大爷
It was back into the 80s, Da Ye

88
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:51,680
# 就炖羊肉 就那老黄鸡扔进半只去
While brewing lamb, simply put half of an old chicken into the pot

89
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,240
# 那羊肉巨香 绝对的
The lamb was awesome. Absolutely

90
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,920
# 小亮你还得把老的传统弄出来
Xiao Liang, you need to preserve the old traditions

91
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,320
# 好啊 再结合一下
Sure. Combine the traditions with new situations

92
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,120
# 那绝对特别香那羊肉
The lamb is absolutely going to be incredibly tasty

93
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,600
# 不夸张的说你师父就是个神人
I am not flattering. Your master is a legend

94
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,120
# 敢想才能出好东西
You need to be brave enough to create good stuff

95
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,080
# 这个羊肉一定要洗它两遍到三遍
The lamb must be rinsed two or three times

96
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,200
# 因为这个步骤是很关键的一步
This is a really critical step

97
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,400
# 有一些网友啊
Some friends may think that

98
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,280
# 我们这儿羊肉没有你这么费事
'in my home, we don't have to do so much to prepare the lamb'

99
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,200
# 咱在家里边不比产地资源这么优势
Honestly, most people don't have nice lamb as you do in the place of production

100
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,000
# 一定要给它处理得干干净净
So we must wash it thoroughly

101
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,840
# 您店里边卖也是 您出来好吃才行
It's the same for restaurants. You must make sure it's delicious when the dish is done

102
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,760
# 这就行了
This should be ok.

103
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,280
# 水一开往里一搁就行
When the water is boiling, simply pouring it into this pot

104

And that's done. All original flavor

105

Let's put four dried chili peppers into the pot

106
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,000
# 一斤放肉一个 这是四斤肉
One chili pepper per 500 g of meat. We have 2 kg here

107
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,680
# 水开了 直接往里边一倒
The water is boiling. Directly pour into the pot

108
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,080
# 加什么调料么
Do we need to add any ingredient or spice?

109
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,760
# 什么都不加 连盐都不加
Nothing. Not even salt

110
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,800

# 这汤多清亮啊
Look how clear the broth is

112
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,320
# 开火
Let's start heating

113
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,000

114
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,960
# 压了四十五分钟 又闷了二十五分钟
Pressure-cooked for 45 minutes. Then kept in the pot (sealed) for 25 minutes.

115
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,840
# 真烂乎 倍儿烫
That's totally stewed. Too hot

116
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,000
# 拿布拿布 我给你拿
Get a towel. Let me get one for you

117
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,080

118
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,800
# 其实他也烫 我还真不烫
-In fact he can feel the heat, too. -Not really!

119
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,520
# 咱们这个上面要是有油
If we have floating oil here

120
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,360
# 不要它 打掉它
Get rid of it with a spoon

121
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,600
# 下一步 先给它捞出来
Next step. Taking out of the water first

122
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,480

123
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,600
# （辣椒）不要了
Throw away (the chili peppers)

124
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,120

No ginger, no green onion. Just four chili peppers

125
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,400
# 原汁原味
That's the original flavor

126
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,280
# 进行下一步 煸蒜
Next step. Fry the garlic

127
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:30,480
# 半斤蒜 油不要太热 花生油
250 grams of garlic. The oil shouldn't be too hot. Use peanut oil

128
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,440
# 稍微让它有一起泡就行了 中火
Just let it bubble a bit. Use medium heat

129
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,880
# 千万不要油太热再下蒜
Never fry the garlic with overheated oil

130
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,520
# 要让它凉一点 别让它上色
Cook at a relatively low temperature. Don't let the garlic turn brown

131
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,760
# 表面一起泡 透了就行了
It's done when you can see small bubbles on the surface of garlic

132
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:45,360
# 这蒜出来应该是跟肉的颜色差不多
The garlic should have a similar color to the lamb (when the dish is done)

133
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,240
# 让它吃的得特别的面
The garlic will be very soft finally

134
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,920
# 这就行了 看见了吧
This is done. See that?

135
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:52,040
# 师父您照一下 全都起小泡了
Master, please shoot this. All with small bubbles

136
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:55,000
# 也不能让它上色 一上色这火就大了
Shouldn't let the garlic turn brown. In that case, the temperature is too high

137
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,760
# 把火加大
Now use high heat

138
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:00,160

139
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,160
# 这小锅翻的
Look how you toss the wok. Nice!

140
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,760

141
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,280
# 它有一个煸炒
We need a frying step here

142
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,560
# 这个原汤往里边加的时候
When you add the broth into the wok

143
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:13,040
# 一定要缓慢的往里加 烹进去

144
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,600

145
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,720
# 大火催开它 全都翻开了
Use high heat to boil the broth

146
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,480

149

# 说句实话 当时我在
In fact, when I had this dish

150
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,720
# 人家西北那儿吃这个菜的时候

00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,920
# 人家是清汤
That dish was served with clear broth

# 正常情况下大火的话

# 这汤比这还白还浓

158
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,560
# 他为什么逐步加汤
Why is he adding the broth in separate steps?

159
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,400
# 因为它这温度达不到
Because the temperature is not high enough here

160
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,760
# 你要一下闷了你就冲不出来了
If you add too much broth in one go, the fatty droplets stay inside the meat and will not go out #理论上奶白汤是由于脂肪滴的悬浊液，这里加了一点解释

161
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,400
# 您看刚才 大爷 我洗这么多遍
