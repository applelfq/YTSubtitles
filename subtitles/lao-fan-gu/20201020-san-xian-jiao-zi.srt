# 好了 三鲜馅的
Alright, Sanxian filling (pork, shrimps, sea cucumbers, chives) dumplings

4
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:11,160

# 我们和面当中要搁点盐
We need some salt in the dough

7
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:17,800
# 使这面更加有劲 别太多
So that it’s stiffer but don’t add too much

8
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,480
# 饺子面要注意 有一句话叫
There’s a saying for the dumpling dough:

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,800
# 软面饺子 硬面汤
Soft dough for dumplings and stiff dough for soup

10
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,400
# 饺子面子比烙饼面稍微硬点
The dumpling dough should be a little stiffer than the pancake dough

11
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,480
# 比面条面稍微软点
And a little softer than the noodle dough

12
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,560
# 和面也得匀着往里加水 和的才滋润
Add water gradually when you are kneading the dough so it’s even

13
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,640
# 好了 咱们开始揣揣
Alright let’s knead it into a dough

14
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,800
# 盆光面光手光 三光
The surfaces of the pot, the dough and your hands should be clean at last

15
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,880
# 您这三鲜馅够豪华
It’s a deluxe choice of Sanxian fillings

16
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,880
# 有时候我在家里要没有海参的时候
When we could not find some sea cucumbers

17
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,400
# 也可以找一个东西替海参
We could have an alternative for that

18
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,200
# 你知道什么么
Guess what?

19
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,520
# 木耳 木耳也挺脆的
It’s the wood ears because they are also crunchy

20
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,240
# 行了 然后让它饧一会儿
Alright, let it rest for a while

21
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:57,640
# 猪肉 虾仁 海参 韭菜
Pork, shrimps, sea cucumbers and chives

22
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,680
# 我这儿开始准备准备馅儿
I’ll start making the fillings

23
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,320
# 海参这肠有的人不爱去
Some will forget to remove the intestine of sea cucumbers

24
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,360
# 有时候不去它腥
But it has a bad smell

25
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,320
# 找个小锅给它出一下水
Grab a small pot and boil the sea cucumbers

26
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,320
# 来两片姜 来点酒 黄酒
Two slices of garlic with some huangjiu rice wine in the water

27
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,120
# 再来几个葱 还得搁点盐
Also some green onions and some salt

28
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:18,080
# 这去掉海参的腥味和给它增加点味道
These remove the bad smell of sea cucumbers and add some flavors to it

29
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,200
# 然后咱把虾仁给它处理一下
Now let’s deal with the shrimps

30
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,120
# 这虾仁买的是现成的
These are store bought

31
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,080
# 这虾线都挑干净了
and deveined

32
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,840
# 现在这海鲜便宜 比吃肉还便宜 白菜价
Now it’s cheaper to have seafood than meat. Almost like cabbages

33
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,400
# 水开了海参下锅 开锅五分钟
Sea cucumbers in the boiling water and boil them for 5 minutes

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,600
# 剩下虾就不拍了 让它有点颗粒度
We won’t need to splash the rest shrimps, remain some texture

35
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,040
# 这个您是想和到馅儿里么
So these shrimps are for the fillings?

36
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:45,120
# 对 但是分头打 分头调味
Yeah but we season the pork and shrimps separately

37
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:49,840
# 因为肉馅儿的味儿重 虾馅的要轻
Because the meat need strong seasoning while shrimps need light seasoning

38
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,240
# 要混在一块调 容易虾就咸了
If seasoned them together, the shrimps will be too salty

39
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,280
# 齐了 真黏糊
Alright, it’s so sticky

40
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,320
# 好了 拿出来
Alright, grab the sea cucumbers

41
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,720
# 这海参可多可少
The amount of sea cucumber depends (on your preference)

42
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,720
# 爱吃的就是虾仁 海参 少搁肉
If you like it, then put more shrimps and sea cucumbers and less meat

43
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:07,000
# 这点就基本上一个饺子里有一个海参丁
With these, it’s basically just having one piece of sea cucumber in every dumpling

44
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,240
# 来点姜米 有韭菜不搁葱 一定要记住了
Also some chopped ginger. No need for green onions when we have chives, keep that in mind.

45
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,680
# 肉馅是这样
The meat fillings is like this

46
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,360
# 一般咱们家里头都拿筷子打馅儿
We usually mix the ground meat with chopsticks

47
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,360
# 筷子打馅就慢
That way is too slow

48
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,800
# 上手打 酱油
Just use your hands. Some soy sauce

49
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,960
# 这个肉馅的比例就是买肥瘦
Keep a good portion of fat in the ground pork

50
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,800
# 肥三瘦七 前腿
Thirty percent fat. That’s usually pork legs

51
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,240
# 首先抓抓
Grab a few times first

52
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:35,680
# 打馅不加料酒 可以加味精
Don’t put cooking wine yet but some MSG

53
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,240
# 盐 这饺子馅儿必须得味重
Some salt. The fillings must have strong flavor 

54
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,760
# 不味重它不好吃
Otherwise it’s not good

55
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,200
# 少来 这要颜色的 老抽
A little bit of Laochou dark soy sauce for the color

56
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,720

57
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,280
# 这个馅还得要摔摔它
The ground pork fillings need to be beaten

58
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,160
# 以前的肉都是养一年的猪
Long time ago, all the pork come from pigs older than one year

59
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,960
# 它肉香味浓 您多打点水没事
Those pork have strong flavors and you can mix more water in the fillings

60
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,160
# 稍微打点水可以
A little bit more water

61
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,920
# 现在肉打多了就没味了
But the pork these days will be bland with too much water in the fillings

62
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,280
# 摔得有劲 包饺子容易抱团
Beaten enough, the fillings can easily get to a ball inside the skins

63
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,680
# 抱团还出汁儿呐
Also juicier

64
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,880

65
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,720
# 虾肉 海参丁 姜米放进 去
Shrimps, sea cucumber pieces, ginger pieces, in

66
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:11,840
# 这一抓挠 把荤馅打完了以后
When the meat filings are ready

67
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,160
# 如果说我们一小时两小时以后才包呢
If there is still time before making the dumplings

68
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,800
# 就放在冰箱里头 让它镇一镇
Let the fillings rest in the fridge

69
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,000
# 素馅不要着急往里边一块和

70
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,400
# 什么时候包什么时候和 来油
Mix the veggies with the meat just before making dumplings. Now some oil in

71
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,080
# 就仗着这油呢 多搁点油没事 花生油

72
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:31,000
# 香油 二合油 这叫什么
Also some sesame oil mixed. What’s this called?

73
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,400
# 按照咱们老北京话说 这叫味上馅
In our Beijing dialect, it’s putting flavors in the fillings

74
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,840
# 你看这馅儿倍儿腻乎
See how sticky the fillings is now

75
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,720

# 咱择韭菜的时候 我们在家里择韭菜

77
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:44,200
# 拿剪子 最后把根给去了
Use a pair of scissors to cut the roots

78
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,880
# 为什么这上边 有时候搁韭菜有沙子

79
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,360
# 第一刀有时候就不要了

00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,960
# 买韭菜买那紫根的 比这个细
The ones with purple roots are better, which is a bit thinner

83
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:03,800
# 那个韭菜是更香 那叫鸡脖韭
That one has a better smell and it has a nickname, called "chicken neck chives"

84
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,680
# 咱就搁在里头了
Now let’s put the chives in there

85
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,360
# 什么时候包 什么时候和
Mix the veggies in the fillings just before making the dumplings

86
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,880
# 老早和了你要不包 一会儿塌了

98
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,520
# 这面差不多了
It seems about right

99
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,560
# 这面揉完了还得饧一下
After kneading it again, let it rest again

100
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,160
# 再饧三分钟五分钟
For another 3-5 minutes

101
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,760
# 亮子咱开剂儿
Lianzi, let’s split the dough

102
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,880

103
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,800

It’s so white

104
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,360
# 您揪啊您不切 我不切 我是半专业
You’re pulling instead of cutting. Yeah I’m semi-professional

106
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,640

# 擀剂儿
Roll this small piece of dough

115

# 您这娴熟的手法
Whoa, you are so good at this

116
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,960
# 一看您也在家里边经常包 经常做
I guess you often make dumplings at home too

117
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,920
# 这时候可以攉拢到一块去了
Now we mix the veggies into the fillings

118
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,640
# 韭菜碧绿碧绿的
Look at how green the chives are

119
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,560
# 包饺子是这样的
Making dumplings is like this

120
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,880
# 在饭店里边就学会了挤饺子
I learnt how to make dumplings in a restaurant

121
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,920
# 我老捏不好这头
I always have problem nipping this end

122
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,000
# 我就先把这头给它封上
So I first seal this end

123
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,720
# 一挤 倍儿棒
Then nip the dumpling. There you go

124
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,800

125
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,320
# 我们家包饺子就是馅比较大
Dumplings in my house have big portion of fillings

126
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,440
# 吃饺子要有仪式感 皮儿薄馅儿足
It has a special festival feeling with thin skins and a lot of fillings

127
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,800
# 大爷包的还挺快
Daye is making so many dumplings

128
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,520
# 煮饺子也有点小窍门
There is also a trick for boiling the dumplings

129
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,760
# 我们给它煮的时候搁点盐
Put some salt in the boiling water

130
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,080
# 它互相不爱粘
So that the dumplings won’t stick to each other

131
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,800

132
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,160
# 宽水 上盖
Wide boiling water, lid on

133
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,840
# 煮饺子的时候一定要让它悬起来
When we are boiling the dumplings, it’s essential to let them float

134
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,760
# 开锅就漂
Once the water is boiling, they should be floating

135
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:14,600
# 我们有一句话叫开锅煮馅 闭锅煮皮
We have a saying that uncover it to cook the filling and cover it to cook the skin

136
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,120

137
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,200
# 开锅了 开锅咱就不用盖了
It’s boiling right now, then we can take the lid off

138
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,920
# 有时候像茴香馅
Sometimes, for fillings like fennel

139
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,800
# 有时候为了保持茴香让它绿
In order to keep them green

140
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,240
# 打馅儿的时候那里边还可以捏点碱
We can have some alkali in the fillings

141
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,600
# 茴香就不是黄的了 就是绿的
